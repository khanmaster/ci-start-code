# Why should we use SSH with Git-hub

## SSH keys and Git-hub
### There are two methods to clone the repo

``` SSH AND HTTPS ```
- We have two types repos ```public repo``` 

- second is ```private repo```


- generate SSH keys on your local system
- copy the key from local system to the specific repo on git-gub (ci-start-code)
- .ssh fodler where we ssh keys available
- name new key as your name shahrukh
- cat filename.pub
- copy the key
- go to your git-hub to the specific repo
- click on settings
- click on deploy keys
- add deploy
### It is essential and the best practice to write descriptive names i.e shahrukh-jenkins
- Now the secured public key form your local system has been copied to our cloud/Git-hub
